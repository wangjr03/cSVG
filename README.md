# cSVG: Improved spatial domain detection by Spatially Variable Gene Clustering Adjusting for Cell Type Effect 

cSVG is a Gaussian process-based method that initially identifies SVGs and then establishes a dependency map among these SVGs using an intuitive approach. This map links each SVG with other SVGs exhibiting similar spatial patterns, ultimately clustering similarly expressed SVGs together. The resulting SVG-clusters from the cSVG algorithm can serve as inputs for further downstream analysis, for example spatial domain detection.
